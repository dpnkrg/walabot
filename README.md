## Purpose
Detect the distance of the target.

## Requirement
### Hardware
* Normal PC or laptop
* Walabot Device ([Link](http://walabot.com/))

### Software
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04
* Tensorflow 0.8.0
* Opencv 3.0.0
* H5PY
* Matplotlib
* Walabot SDK ([Link](http://www.walabot.com/getting-started))

## Before you start
This project is just for entertaiment and there are several models for different purpose, such as material classification & display silhouette of target. The effect can not be guaranteed and it is not recommended to the tensorflow beginner to use it. The most important thing is *"HAVING FUN!"*.

## How to build up training/validation/test data?

1. Execute buildAll.sh. It logs antenna's signal(tx==1) at antenna folder.The log name format is tx-rx.txt.

2.Execute test/log5.py to create training/validation/test data.
